# Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code

Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Overview

This is my implementation of the Unscented Kalman Filter Project in term 2 of CarND.

In this project I utilized an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. I obtained RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the project rubric.

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO.

It is now modified into a library structure so other programs can use it as a library.

## Compile and Execute

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

Here is the main protcol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.

**INPUT:** values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurment that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)

**OUTPUT:** values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]

## Other Important Dependencies

- cmake >= 3.5
  - All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
- make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  - Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  - Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  - Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  - Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  - Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF` Previous versions use i/o from text files.  The current state uses i/o
from the simulator.

## Editor Settings

We recommend using the following settings:

- indent using spaces
- set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as much as possible.

## Criteria

The algorithm has been tested against "obj_pose-laser-radar-synthetic-input.txt". When collecting the positions that the algorithm outputs and comparing them to ground truth data, the generated px, py, vx, and vy RMSE should be less than or equal to the values [.09, .10, .40, .30].

## Generating Additional Data

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
